# Image Captioning with Deep Learning

This project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating text sequences. The goal is to design a system that can automatically generate accurate captions for images.

## Project Overview

The project will utilize a pre-trained Xception model for feature extraction from images and an LSTM network to generate text descriptions. The goal is to provide an end-to-end solution for automatic image captioning by combining these models effectively.

### Key Objectives
1. Understand and apply CNNs for image feature extraction.
2. Use LSTM networks for generating textual sequences.
3. Learn data preprocessing and the steps involved in preparing datasets for deep learning models.
4. Implement an end-to-end image captioning system.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and optimize it for better results.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Flickr_8K Dataset** for training and testing the model.

### Dataset Details:
- 8,000 images from real-world environments.
- Each image has 5 different captions written by different people.
  
The dataset needs to be processed before it can be used:
- Split into training, validation, and testing datasets.
- Images need to be resized and normalized.
- Text captions should be tokenized, and a vocabulary should be created to convert the text into numerical format.

## Models and Techniques

### 1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
- **Model**: Xception (pre-trained)
- **Usage**: Feature extraction from images.
- The last classification layers of the pre-trained Xception model are removed, and the intermediate layer outputs are used as feature representations of the images.

### 2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
- **Usage**: Generate captions based on the features extracted by CNN.
- The LSTM network is used to predict the next word in a sequence based on the image features and the previously generated words.

### 3. **Embedding Layer**:
- Embedding layers are used to represent words as dense vectors, making them understandable for the model.

### 4. **Enhancement Techniques**:
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting by halting training when performance stops improving.
- **Dropout**: Increase model generalization by randomly disabling neurons during training.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adjust the learning rate to speed up convergence and improve model training.

### 5. **End-to-End System**:
- The CNN and LSTM models are combined into an end-to-end image captioning system. The system takes an image as input and generates a caption as output.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using several metrics:
- **BLEU Score**
- **METEOR Score**
- **CIDEr Score**

These metrics are used to assess the quality of the generated captions by comparing them with human-written captions.

## Results and Visualization

- The results will be presented with images alongside their corresponding human-written captions and the captions generated by the model.
- A graphical representation of model performance and error analysis will be provided.
